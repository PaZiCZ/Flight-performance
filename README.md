# Flight-performance
The repository contains a basic flight performance analysis discussed in the Flight Mechanics course at the Institute of Aerospace Engineering. The code can analyse an existing aircraft model or create a new model based on some aircraft parameters and description.

The main parts of the project are:  
main.py - main control file which calls a sequence of the flight performance analysis  
xxx.txt - Input file with xxx aircraft description, includes aircraft geometrical characteristics, power unit choice, and drag polar characteristics  
isa.py - define international standard atmosphere parameters  
power.py - functions which return power estimation of the engine and propeller based on engine type  
flight_analysis.py - analyse flight performance  
out.py - plot graphical results of the flight performance analysis 
constants.py - file for constants, recently g and rho0 are defined here
joke.py - read a joke of the day from "https://jokesoftheday.net/"
plot_flight_performance.py - generates output plots
readplane.py - reading aircraft parameters from input file xxx.txt
specifications.py - define speed and altitude range and number of analysed points
